This folder contains the front and the backend of WebRA



To run the program, there need some extra packages. Due to the limitation of filesize on GitHub, we put them on a web disk.

1. language model, please put the bin.gz file in the folder ./language_model

Moreover, the backend requires some python packages.

- flask

- re

- numpy

- codecs

- joblib

- itertools

- matplotlib

- networkx

- shutil

- os

- gensim

  

After all these files are correctly placed and python packages are installed. You can run the backend of the system. 

The command is 'python ./backend/Backend.py'

Then, you can open the ./graphvisual/dist/index.html to perform your alignment. The aligned result will be put in ./result and ./log will log the statistical data of the system.
